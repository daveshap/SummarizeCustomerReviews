Great for kids - I have purchased other tablets such as a kurio for kids and this is by far the best. It has all the apps you need as an adult, great for both adults and kids to read books and great visuals. Only bad thing like my old Kindle fire, the micro-usb portion gets loose.
recommended by a friend. - It's a great item to have when you are out and about. It's easy to connect to Wi-Fi and it's small enough to fit in my purse.
Very good for reading, email, internet - Pros: 5 Ghz wifi, supports expansion cardsCons: app store a little limited though there is apparently a workaround Other: the ads fed from Amazon are not terribly intrusiveOverall, the tablet seems to work well and is a good value,
good - Am happy with my purchase and the item is being used by my brother's son and he is also happy as on dat
Great tablet at a great price - This is a superb tablet for the price. It doesn't come with the Android operating system. It has Amazon's operating system. The battery last a good long time and apps run very fast. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a tablet.
Fit my need - I need a tablet for reading ebooks and search dictionary for new vocabulary. This one fit my need and it can also check email, listen music and go online searching stuff. I have iPad at home and put this at office, so I don't need to bring the same tablet back and forth. It suits my need very well.
Good value - Purchase for a 12 year old. Sturdy, easy to usr. Great price
Great features and affordable - I went in to buy my 88 year old Dad an Amazon Fire book reader....The customer service from the begining was great!. An Associate immediately approached me, showed me several models, with explaining them all. After picking one. I was then told of the "free shipping" of which i did utilize. My dad received within a couple of days , on his birthday, and was able to go to his local Best Buy, and have an Assocate show/explain how to use. He was sooo excited and pleased with the item and service....and so am I. Also, the price was right tooo!
Mother's Day Gift - I purchased this as a Mother's Day gift for my Mom in Florida. I don't have first hand experience with it but the price point is great and the other reviews seem solid. I did watch a few unboxing videos on youtube and it seems to be a great deal. Some people seem to have issues with the screen being too glossy but other than that I don't see a ton of other problems.
Great tablet - Got this tablet for my spouse who has never had one before and it's perfect for him!
Grandkids love them - We purchased 4 of these for our grandkids aged 18 months to 6 yrs and all 4 of them love them. They play with them daily for as long as their parental limits allow. They are very durable and come with a very kid durable skin. The 2 year warranty that covers everything was the selling part for us. The one con is that you don't get google play store.
Love it! - This new Fire tablet with 16 GB of internal memory is an upgrade from my older 8 GB version, allowing more storage of books, movies and apps.
Great - Great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Highly recommend - The Amazon Fire 7 Tablet 16GB is very a good value... highly recommend.
Great new features - Perfect size. Love new features. Easy to use......
A lot of entertainment for the money - This was purchased to give as a Christmas gift. It's no iPad, of course, but that's not really the idea. It's a strong performer for the money and, in our case, allowed an Amazon Prime member, who didn't have a tablet, to enjoy some entertainment when traveling or hanging around the house for the first time. Made a great gift, he's very pleased.
Fantastic - Parental controls are key. My boys can download games within the parameters I set and I get notification of any purchases. 2 year no questions asked replacement is key.
Great for young kids learning - My son loves it he's only 3 understands how to use it and I can see it has helped him learn word animals and etc.. it's a very good way to keep the brain moving and active.
Great product, and you can't beat the price - Much lighter than my old kindle. Love it, love the fact that it has the camera too
Good size - We have the smaller one, and been great. This one is even better, because of the size.
NIce Budget Tablet - Nice basic tablet for the price. Screen colors are muted and text was not that sharp. But, for the price, it does what I need it to do (surf the web, listen to music, read ebooks, watch movies).
Great for kids - Amazon free time great for small kids to get entertained
Nice Tablet for the money - Nice Tablet for games and keeping up on social media!
Soooo cool! - I got the first version for my sister and she hasn't been able to put it down on over a year. Then I got her this one and forget about it. Great new features, she loves loves loves it!
Good - Thank..............................................

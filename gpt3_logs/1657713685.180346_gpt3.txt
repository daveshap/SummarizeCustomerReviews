Great for my child - Loved it! Great product for my 10 year old son!!!!
great tablet - i really enjoy this tablet made a great christmas gift
Great Tablet - I have always been a Nook customer, but recently their models have not received good feedback. So, while shopping for a new ereader, i had to make the decision between the two. The biggest influence behind price. While the new Samsung model of the Nook definitely looks great, it also has a big price tag. Overall, we are very happy with this purchase. It is mostly used as an ereader, but we have downloaded a few games. Kindle is a good reputable tablet and is a good solid ereader.
Great gift - Bought online for my granddaughter and she loves it, I have to get one for myself after seeing the quality of the picture,
Burned by fire - I like this tablet. I had a nook, the fire has more memory, bigger screen and lower price. The downside? The Amazon Fire is so ridiculously proprietary that I cannot watch any of my movies on it from my nook. This is becoming industry standard. Too bad.
Great Tablet for Kids - Couldn't recommend this more for kids. Price and features are awesome along with parental controls.
Great Fire Tablet - We purchased this for my 5 year old granddaughter so that she would have something to play games and read books without having to use her mom's devices. She took to it immediately. It connects easily to a 2.4 ghz network but does not support connectivity to a 5; search and downloads did appear a bit slow but did not do testing to see if it was the Fire or the network, then again, it was running updates. The camera takes great pictures even if a child is a bit shakey... Sound quality is very good as is touch sensitivity.
breaks easily - I have always bought nabi's they have lasted for a couple of years with my grandkids This item I bought for my six year old grandson as an upgrade (his nabi lasted 26 months) This broke in two days after giving it to him, It would not charge and the LCD went out . I am now having to jump through hoops to get it replaced .
Good - This is a step up from what my son was using. He said it does well and easy to use.
Perfect gift - My children loved their previous kindles so much I bought them an upgrade with the case - so worth it.

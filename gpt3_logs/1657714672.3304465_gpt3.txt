Great product. - Had a smaller version. Love the bigger screen. Use this product more than a computer.
-bloated - Great tablet. Great performance and is stable. I have ipads and other tablets and I really enjoy reading and watching shows on my kindle fire vs any other tabletThe kid version is kind of annoying. So.many. apps.. ugh. And kids dont understand that they have to wait longer if they're going to download 100 apps at one time..
-Easy Peasy - Easy to transfer my stuff from my old Kindle into this new one. Love the price and how easy it is to use. Great buy.
-Very happy with it. - I wanted a lighted ebook reader and also access to the internet in a small format. The Fire meets my needs at a great price.
-Slow performance - Slow performance and charging port very low poor quality it gets frozen most of the times
-Nice - Currently setting everything up on it but so far so good.
-Daughter loves it - Purchased for my daughter. She loves it. $129.99 and even got a price adjustment once it went it sale.
-Good overall table for a kid - My sons first table since school is using apps now for supplemental math. He loves it and the child controls are great. Performance is solid, particularly for a grade school kid. The case and price point make this a great buy.
-Great for every day use - I use this all the time. So much better than bringing out the laptop.
-It's great - my 6 year old has not put this down!! It is easy to use and she loves the games that are already preinstalled!
-Kind of complicated - I bought 2 of these tablets for my two youngest children. They had a lot of options to chose from as far as children apps go, but they were already familiar with the iPad since they stole mine all the time. Lol. That made it hard for them as well as myself to figure out how to use at first. Besides that, it's a good product.
-Good for my 11 year old son - My son uses the device to help him do his homework
-Significantly improved - This product is significantly improved over my previously owned first generation Kindle and first generation Fire. The resolution is better, the programmable features are more numerous and the response is quicker.

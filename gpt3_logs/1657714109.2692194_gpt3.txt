Love it for children - My granddaughter loves this tablet. Perfect for a 5 year old
-My first tablet - This is my first tablet. So far, I am pleased with my Fire Tablet. I am not a gamer, I do basic internet searches and check e-mail. Is easier due to size, than using my smart phone. No problems or issues to this point.
-Great for kids - My kids love the product. Really durable after drops.
-Loved it - I bought this for my niece and she loves it. We take it everywhere.
-Great speed no lagging - I feel that this tablet was the perfect fit for my boys age 8 and 6.
-This is the clearest screen ive ever seen - this tablet has the best battery ive ever seen. The picture is great too.
-Great kids tablet - my 2 year old daughter loves this tablet! I witnessed her drop it once (off the couch to laminate floor) nothing I can tell was affected. I was a little reluctant to buy this for such a young child, but with the way we seem to rely on technology these days, plus the cost, I just had to buy it. my favorite feature is the parental controls that allow me to set times ...not just times that it can be used but for certain content as well! I can set the tablet so when my older kids (10 and 8) log in, they need to complete educational tasks for an allotted amount of time before free play... and the whole thing logs out after a certain time so I don't have to go searching for it in their rooms at night :) great tablet, glad I got the bumper too, great price
-Kids Tablet - Bought this nice kindle fire kids tablet for my 18 month son for a 6 hour road trip to LA and it did the job. I downloaded some movies and apps from Amazon to keep the little guy busy. He absolutely loved it and best thing is the case it's very durable. Plus with 2 year guarantee if anything happens they'll replace it for free. We both love it!
-Awesome Kid's Tablet - Great tablet for my 3 yr old. Love the profile options and parental controls!
-A Great first tablet - My Grandson can't put it down! With access to so many educational apps and games, you really can't lose.
-nice tablet - if you like the old kindle fire it just like the new one but better, better screen and more space
-Love my Fire - Excellent value, lets me lug all my favorite books around and read whenever. Wouldn't be without it.
-Kindle upgrade - My new Kindle is an upgrade from my 7 year old Kindle Fire. As to be expected the video quality is better along with faster performance and more features. I still use my old Kindle as it is still ticking but the "shiny new toy" is fun.
-Very awesome! - So I was trying this out before giving it to my son and ended up playing the games for like an hour! Some of the games are amazing quality! Just like the cartoon shows, but more interactive. We bought 2 for my twins to use on an upcoming plane ride and can't wait to see their reactions! Love it!
-Tablet - Love my tablet easy to work and have no problem with down loads.and lite weight.
-great for kids - got it on black friday for $79.99my 2 year old love it
-Great substitute for ipad - Being used to an Ipad this is difficult to adust to but does the job just fine for a low price - good size to carry around without weighing down your purse. Would buy again
-Great price, great item - Tons of value, if you want a budget tablet look no further.
-My Kindle fire 8 - I really enjoy my new kindle, still getting used to it.
-Fantastic - Great buy for the money, no complaints. Highly recommended.

-Kindle Fire - We bought one for my son and he liked it so much we bought another one for my other son. We did upgrade to the 8 inch screen.
-Great tablet - This is a great product at a great price I would definitely recommend this to anybody especially good for college students or people that read books etc.

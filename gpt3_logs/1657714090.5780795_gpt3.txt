Great product - My granddaughter loves this and it came as promised.
-Keeps My 2 Year Old Entertained - Bought this tablet for our 2 year old. She loves to watch videos of nursery rhymes and Bubble Guppies. I can finally get some housework done without interruption. So user friendly, even a 2 year old can figure it out!
-Great tablet - I bought this tablet to replace my textbook. It has everything I want and need. I only purchased it after I learned you can download from google play. The amazon equivalent to google play has a lot of the same apps and games.
-Gifts - I just set them up but they seem great and easy to use. I'm planning on given it as a gift to my father and I don't forsee any problems
-Doesn't support youtube red video downloads - I bought this tablet to download videos from youtube red and to be able to take the tablet everyone we travel to play the videos. But unfortunately this tablet model does not support youtube red and it definitely doesn't work without wifi. So that was a fail! I'm gonna need to figure out how to download stuff so we can run the tablet without being connected to wifi. Other then that it's good for your little ones older then 3 or 4 years of age. It's big so they might have trouble holding it up but if they sit down with it then all the apps help promotes them to keep engaged and interested to sit still. Great case protector!
-Nice combination of reader and tablet. - I went into bestbuy to purchase a replacement after mine died. I loved my kindle, and decided to get 2-in-1 with the fire. It is perfect for my needs.
-Girl tablet - I like that the tablet has child settings and time usage. Very helpful in setting time limits.
-Good - I use it everyday after work for down time.........
-East to use - I love how easy and interactive product is. Set up in a snap with easy to follow directions.
-Great price - This is a great Tablet at a really great price. The best part is if you happen to break it just buy a new one
-Good tablet - Has what is necessary for the average individuals needs.
-Perfect tablet for kids - The price for this tablet is not the only great selling point. The free year of amazon free time is perfect for my son. There are tons of games, books, and videos in this service. My favorite feature is how we can set time limits on screen time. We can even set it to require an amount of learning app or book time per day before access to games is allowed. Great choice for kids.
-Playtime for hours - Bought for my daughter and she loves it. Keeps her busy for hours.
-Love it - I traded this in after receiving a 7" at Christmas and I am happy I did. I love the size of the screen for reading my books (which I have too many of) and a great size for watching movies. I do wish I had the capability to use internet when I am away from home, yet other than that, this is a great buy.
-My Sister's gift - I bought my sister the original Kindle years ago. She kept it for so long that it had a spot in the middle of the screen that was like a bright light. For her birthday I got her this one & she can't leave it alone! She loves it!
-Amazing! - I didn't expect anything less than what I got with this Kindle.
-great reader my dautgher loves it - my daughter just loved this kindle fire. she said it was the perfect gift that she could receive.
-Great device - This is just an awesome tablet for the price and the features it has
-Good for kids under 10y - My son enjoys to play with his tablet but definitely you gotta take a little time to set it up for them to be safe while they are playing with.
-great for kids - very durable and easy to work with. I love its functionality and my kid loves having his own tablet. good stuff
-Handy - Great device. Works very well and use it throughout the day.Keeps me informed and great for looking up things and staying in contact.
-Great tablet for the kiddo - Has all the functionality a child needs with easy parental controls. Like the child profile with only approved content.
-Good for me - The size is just right for me to carry anywhere and it's simple to figure out the functions. 32 G would help me store many ireader books for a long time. I have read 3 books so far.
-Great choice for kids! - We purchased this Amazon Fire - Kids Edition for my 3 year-old granddaughter. Could not have made a better choice! She was up and running in no time and absolutely loves it.In fact, when my wife (who has an older model Fire tablet) started playing with it, she was so impressed with its capabilities that she now wants one for herself.Very pleased with our purchase!

Great for kids!! - Fire kids edition, I love it, because kid just can find movies and games especially for them, I don't have to be worry about Reader "r" movies that accidentally they can watch
-Fire tablet - My husband loves the tablet it works great and I bought it for him
-Bought for my 24 year old daughter, she LOVES it!! - It's amazing. My daughter loves reading on it, watching Netflix, going online to look things up, etc. She loves the touchscreen aspect, and the settings are advanced, but very user friendly. Easy to navigate. Lots of great features for a very low price. The only negative is that the camera is not the best quality. But that's not important to her.

-Is a great gift for the kids. - This tablet is great and easy to use. Great way to keep the kids entertain.
-Great for what you pay for - It helps if your an amazon prime member . You can download a lot more things to do on the tablet
-Excellent - I had been looking for a smaller tablet. The new Fire HD8 is the perfect fit. It's great for media of all types. It's even a pretty good gaming device. But keep your expectations in check. It won't do everything a full laptop can, but it's not supposed to. The screen is terrific, although you may need to download an app for white balance adjustment.
-It Has Alexa Built In! - Nice price for the new model with Alexa built in and expandable storage!
-A good cheap tablet. - I bought this as a gift to my parents. The unfortunate part was that I was a little misinformed about the connectivity between the tablet and a chrome cast that I purchases as well as part of the gift. The tablet is not compatible with the table and that was a little disappointing. Other than that, it's an alright product.
-EASY FOR KIDS - BOUGHT FOR 3 YEAR OLD GRANDAUGHTER. SHE LOVES IT AND NOW SHE WON'T NEED TO STEAL MOMS TABLET OR PHONE.
-PERFECT FOR THE PURPOSE - I read the reviews before purchasing this so I went into it knowing there will be apps pre-loaded that I will have to remove. That being said, I purchased this for my 7yo daughter and it is perfect for the purpose considering it includes the case and no-hassle protection guarantee.
-GREAT VALUE - The device is priced just right to give as a gift for an 8 year old
-love it works perfect - it was very easy to sit up and get it to working and plying games and down loading
-great for kids - bought this for my grandson as i had bought one a year before for my other grandson. Great for younger ones

-basic kindle - upgraded my 3 year old kindle- same old. doesnt seem that great of a difference. the graphical interface still sucks but its decent for reading.
-Good Tv - Great and informative service. The guy who helped us was very friendly.
-Value for money - Amazon Fire HD8 is a good tab at this price. It's light in weight, easy to use and serves a good purpose for browsing and reading. But if you are looking for a good camera or a tab for video calling, this is not the right choice for you

Beginner to Tablets - I'm new to tablets but this one is pretty easy to understand and use.There's a decent amounts of apps at start up, which can be good and bad.
-Not bad but it?Js very slow - Not really impressed by this item. It is pretty slow.
-Great tablet and compatible with wireless products - We got this for our 10 year old, but I would recommend it for any age 10 and up. Really nice and great compatibility.
-Loving it! - I was reluctant to replace my previous Kindle Fire because I wasn't sure I would like it as well. I am pleased to say I'm loving it!
-Best tablet for kids - Bought this tablet at my local store . The nephews love it
-Wonderful thus far - Bought for my son and he enjoys playing in it. He's able to download all the apps he wanted and the camera is awesome.
-Cost to benefit ratio great - My 14yo daughter loves to read and watch certain shows on Netflix as well as Amazon prime. She is less interested in the apps which is a good thing since you do not have access to google play and all of those apps unless you 'side load' the Google play app which, for the casual person, is more technical that you would like.
-Great tablet. - I love my tablet!! I didn't think at first that I would like this size but it is perfect for me. I would recommend this tablet to all my friends.
-Kindles best - I recently purchased the Kindle Fire 8 to replace a lost Kindle HD. The Fire 8 is an excellent upgrade and much better than the HD. The Fire 8 was recommended by one of the Best Buy staff that was very knowledgeable on the product. I highly recommend the Fire 8 and Best Buy
-Amazon kid version - Tablet is great, battery satisfactory. Case works great, within 10 minutes of opening the tablet, my grandson dropped it. No damage!!Easy to use. Highly recommend.
-Liked it so much I bought two! - Initially we purchased the Kids Kindle Fire for our 3 year old. The parental controls and time limitations are super easy to set up. We have a Samsung Galaxy tablet that our 9 year old son uses, but we ended up getting a second Fire for him because it seemed very kid-friendly and I didn't have to worry about any inappropriate content popping up. Lots of good educational apps and games.
-Best gift we bought this year! - Our son just LIVES this unit. He has all his favorite games on it.
-Great Tablet for Kids - Great tablet, kids love it and have their own. Easy to use
-Easy enough for Grandpa - Tablet has worked without a hitch. We bought it for my father, who is just shy of 80. With a couple of instructions, he's been using it without further assistance.
-Great tablet for a toddler - Love this tablet! Highly recommended, especially for a toddler who's learning. Has lots of games and activities for learning, parental controls, which I find extremely necessary for the internet today!
-Great tablet! - I bought this tablet for my three year old niece. It was easy to set up for her, and she loves it. I also purchased the Kids Free case, to protect it.
-Great beginner tablet - This size holds more apps and content. It's pretty lightweight too.
-Nice tablrt - This tablet is perfect and appropriate for my grandchild
-Best Kindle Yet - Bigger screen, longer battery life and faster loading...an improvement over the last model and a great choice if this is your first tablet. As a college student, it beats spending more on books and having to lug the extra weight on my back
-Great Tablet - Great beginner tablet for all ages. Easy to use by all ages.
-Great Kindle. - I recently upgraded to this model of Kindle. Liked it so much I bought this one for my daughter. She loves it. It's much nicer than the older model she and I had.

-Great 8" tablet!! - Beautiful HD resolution on this tablet. Love the 8" size, not too big nor too small.

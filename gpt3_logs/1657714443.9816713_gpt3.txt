-Great tablet for the kids and book readings. - Its worth every penny. The kids loved it our home is quieter then ever.
-Great kids tablet - This is an awesome tablet for kids. Love the versatility. This is our 2nd since our older son loved his, we felt his younger brother needed one too. The charger is horrible though. Does not charge well at all. Returned the first kindle thinking it was the tablet. After the second had problems charging, I tried my husbands galaxy charger and it fits perfectly. Then we bought this one. Same problem. The charger that comes with the kindle simply does not fit well and give it a good charge. All 3 tablets had the same issue. I have also spoke to other parents who have experienced the same issue. So in summary, the tablet is aweosme. The charger is awful.

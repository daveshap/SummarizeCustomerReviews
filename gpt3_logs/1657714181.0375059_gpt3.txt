-Great value - This tablet is a rock star. I do everything on it. Bright display, sound, And an unbeatable price. Of course, the price point is due to the baked in advertisements that you get every time the device wakes up - a little annoying, but manageable. Again, that price really makes it for me and it really is quite capable.
-I use my Kindle every day. - This is my fifth Kindle and with each new one I have a new feature to use.
-Great product for the money - I love the product. I'm very happy but I would like even more if the page number was displayed when reading books on this tablet, in case I wanted to refer back to a certain page.
-Great for my needs...mainly reading and games. - Excellent price point for my basic requirements. It has all the features I need for comfortable reading of online novels and articles.
-Great buy! - I picked this up as a doorbuster for my father-in-law. He has an Amazon account and can watch the movies he likes.
-Works well - I bought it Xmas for my 4 yr old who always wants our iPhones to watch utube videos. It's cool looking and well made plus Alexa is helpful. It she still prefers our iPhones because the touch screen makes it a bit easier to stop her video and is more sensitive. I like it but don't live it.
-Nice tablet - I got this for my wife and she loves it. Great speed and display

-Kindle fire hd 8th generation - I was using this for a while it was 10X faster then my kindle 5th generation yes 1gb of ram but the App Store made from Amazon is not the best so I downloaded the google play store to get the apps I mostly used I only use my kindle fire had 8 for books and reading or watching YouTube or the web I'm giving the rating 4 stars
-Excellent gift - I bought this for my girlfriend as a Christmas Present. She is a avid reader and has been using our ipad to read online library books. She asked me for a nook reader, but after seeing the fire....it was a no brainer to go in that direction. it is used everyday and she loves it.

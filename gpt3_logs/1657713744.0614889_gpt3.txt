Excellent - Nice size screen. Very clear picture. The blue color tablet looks very nice. Overall satisfied.
This is my 5th Kindle - So i have bought every generation of Kindle since they came out and they have all been fantastic, especially for read school books.
Can't beat if for the price - What I expected. A better then budget tablet ata good price. Bought for the integration with Alexa and it works well, more info about your Alexa request will show up automatically on the tablet.
Good for the price - Moved all the ad apps to a folder and loaded what I wanted. Small size fits in my sport coat pocket.
Great ereader - I would recommend this ereader above all others for its high quality and diversity. Not only as an ereader but as a web browser.
For my son.... - I bought both of my children one of these tablets...they love it.
Beautiful Tablet - This is such a wonderful value for the money!!Clear display with great color!!

Great tablet! - I love my new Amazon Fire tablet it's great!! The perfect size to fit in my purse so that I can take it with me. I would definitely recommend to a friend.
Great gift for my kids - I bought this fire for my 7 year old and she loves it.
Great Tablet for my grandson. - My grandson love it. Works great. Applications are good for education purposes.
A MUST if you have Amazon Prime - I purchased two of these for my kids, ages 12 and 10. Forget the IPod touch. For the price, this tablet can't be beat! They can download games, books and movies for free all included with my Amazon Prime membership. Awesome!!
Great android tablet - With a little tweaking you can install Playstore without rooting. It's a great tablet, excellent color, fast, and battery lasts a very long time.
So great - I haven't used a product like this and man I have to tell u it's better than apple products
Great for an older mom. - I bought this for my mother for Mother's Day. She absolutely loves it. She uses it everyday. Best thing I ever bought for her.
Great product at a great price - Purchased the tablet for my 9 month old daughter since I notice that she loves phone screens and tablets. Keep in mind isn't intend for kids her age but make sure there is adult supervision. Pluses: the tablet can take a good beating. Tons of hard tapping and even with the tough case can even take biting as well without causing any damage to the pink case. ( daughter is teething lol) . I'm a Amazon prime member,which gives access to tons of shows and free apps. So if you have Prime you can totally take advantage of a full library of entertainment. Some of the apps are great even for my 9 month old daughter works great to keep her entertained. Also when she is older I have tons of options to change and control. Also I get my own side she can't do anything unless I give her action.Cons: Average battery life 5-6hours tops of nonstop use and also wish that there was a way to lock the screen while watching Amazon, Netflix or any other video app so when my daughter taps in any direction or anywhere that the videos wouldn't stop playing.
Excellent learning device for my son - My son is 3 years of age and he love the different types of learning programs this tablet has to offer
Great tablet for young children - Bought this as a gift for my 3 year old granddaughter. She is learning how to get to her apps and play some games on it. I like that I can have contol over what she can watch and play.
Perfect size. Great resolution. - Connects to home WiFi automatically. Many books, and many games. Actually functions like a computer tablet. E-mail is a breeze.
No complaints here - Have been very pleased with all aspects of the Fire HD8. Good performance for the low price.
Charging Ports - I love these Tablets, but the charging ports aren't the best. I bought 3 for Christmas and my kids take excellent care of them. I also do NOT them touch the tablets while they are charging. They have only had their tablets since Christmas day and they won't charge. I highly recommend getting the protection warranty for this item.
Great for step mother - I bought this for my step mom who likes playing solitaire. She wore her hand held game out and couldn't find a replacement. She just loves it and can do a lot of other things on it.
Great for little kids - Bought it for my 8 year old and it was perfect. She loves it and works it with ease.
Perfect phone - Takes great pics. Easy to maneuver. Good screen size

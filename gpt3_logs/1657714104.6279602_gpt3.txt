Great Tablet for children - Nice product . Love the fact that my 5 years sons are gaining computer experiance.
-Extremely Happy - I liked the volume buttons on the side of my old 7" Fire better than on top like this new 8". That's the only reason I didn't give it a 5 star rating.
-Excelent product - I like so much this item, I will recommend this to my friends
-Great but aggravating at times - My son loves it. It does have some flaws though. When he closes an app and then tries to open it again sometimes it has to download all over again. Also, even though apps are supposed to work without wifi, apps will load up fine and then we receive an error message saying we have to download the app again although the app is running perfectly in the background without wifi. Eventually all apps will disappear from the screen until we get back to wifi and restart the tablet.
-Great tablet for kids. - I bought it for my 2 year old and he loves it. It's easy to use and the perfect size for his hands.
-Good tablet for the price - This is my 2nd Amazon tablet. I love it. I also bought one for my husband & mother in law.
-Great product - Tablet is great for kids and adult use. I purchased the tablet to use at school with students with disabilities. The tablet holds up well holds a charge throughout the week. The tablet offers games that do not require Wi-Fi or data. If you have a prime membership there are a lot of benefits when using the fire, for example free apps, free streaming movies & music, etc.
-Great Value for the Money - Easy to set up and durable design. Free time is a great feature, taking parental control to the next level. The screen resolution and camera are amazing.
-My Grand daughter enjoys it she is 6 - She has learned how to play games and learning games. Easy to get to her apps and learned how to download. She charges it every night so it can be ready for her when she gets out of school
-I cherish my kindle it's my window to the world. - I love the internet, tweeting and facebook. No computers can complete me!! My kindle takes care of all my needs ;) !!!Juju
-Great! - Fun to use and also easy for kids to use as well! Good tablet for books and games for all the family!
-Easy to Use - The overall design makes it fir very nice in the hand. It is very easy to setup and has features that I did not utilize on previous Fire tablets. I like the camera and the Blue Shade ability. I like to read before bed and the color really does help me wind down. Long lasting battery!
-Great value for the price... - Overall I am satisfied with the tablet. Nice looking screen and decent sounding speakers. Loads of content kids and adults. Nice device!
-Perfect for my 3 year old - My son loves his tablet! It's easy for him to use and he enjoys all the games that come with it. No problem with the storage or speed of apps. I previously bought him the Samsung tablet and when that broke it was difficult to get it fixed. I like that Amazon gives you a two year warranty.
-perfect for clumsy kids - my son is 5 & is clumsy! hes had this tablet about a month & as many times as hes dropped it still works perfect!
-Very slow - Very slow performance and sometimes applications freeze up and don't work very well , charging port very low quality
-Amazon - Fire Hd8 - 8 - Tablet - 16gb - Wi-fi - The tablet is Excellent! Very fast and well worth the money! The display is great!
-Great - Got this when it was on sale which is what really made it worth getting.
-Bigger screen is nice. - Bought this to replace one I had from about 6 years ago. Why did I wait so long. The newer models bigger screen is so nice and it's so much faster!
-Perfect for little kids - Great for little kids but I have a 10 year old daughter with Autism that loves this. She can watch movies, play games, and READ her favorite books.
-Great Little Tablet - Got this for my 2 year old granddaughter for Christmas. She plays on it till we have to recharge it! She loves it! Great little tablet with a host of capabilities.
-Good price - My Kids are 5 and 9 and love their kindles! I would recommend.
-quick delivery, great price - still learning, previously used a nexus7. Like the larger screen. Reading kindle books on it is good too.
-Christmas Gift - This was a starter Kindle for my grandson. Since I already have a Kindle Fire Tablet that I love, I had no hesitation buying this for someone else. I chose this tablet because of the childproof case and the extended replacement warranty since the gift was for an adolescent boy.
-Kids love these - My children think these are the greatest. I'm kind of partial to agree. You can limit their time, access and the things are built like a tank.

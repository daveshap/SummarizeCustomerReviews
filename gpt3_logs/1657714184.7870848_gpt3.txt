Not charging well - Will not seem to charge all the way and this is my 7th Kindlle.
-bloated - Great tablet. Great performance and is stable. I have ipads and other tablets and I really enjoy reading and watching shows on my kindle fire vs any other tabletThe kid version is kind of annoying. So.many. apps.. ugh. And kids dont understand that they have to wait longer if they're going to download 100 apps at one time..
-Fire 2 - Excellent replacemwnt for an older model of rhe kindle.
-GREAT TABLET - MY DAUTHER LOVES THIS TABLET, IS EXCELLENT FOR A 3 YEARS OLD CHILDREN
-Fun for kids - It's a very reliable tablet for the little ones. Most enjoyable feature is how you can control everything they look at and what kind of apps they use.
-Excellent tablet for the price! - On Christmas Eve I went in looking for an iPad as a gift. They were sold out and I was directed to the Amazon Fire HD8. The picture quality is amazing (hence the HD). I watched a movie on it and the picture was better than my HD tv. I have to say, I would buy this tablet over an iPad any day...AND it cost less than a fourth of the price!
-Great children's apps for free. - Gifts for 4 yr old grandsons very easy for them to maneuver around.. great charge life. We have to force.them to take breaks.
-mostly great - It needs the Internet to connect to your devices and play music. Sometimes you can be cut off. The rest of the time it is easy as can be.
-Great for kids! - I have two kids and they both love it. Its also nice because it is already setup for them.
-Product/Price value is awesome. - The features that I found on the Fire tablet far exceeded my expectations. Well worth the purchase price.
-Great for books - I love my amazon fire. This is the best product I've ever bought. I can get any books I want for way cheaper than they are on store.
-Kindle Fire is on Fire - Amazon's Kindle Fire line only gets better as price gets lower. This is my 3rd Kindle Fire purchased, the first 2 still work well after daily use for more than 3 yrs. A sleeker new design makes the product look more relevant. Some definate improvements over the earlier versions include the rear camera, moving the charging port to the top, and a crisper, clearer screen. The Operating system seems to have been upgraded as well and now is more like a cell phone than a mini computer which I think helps it as well. Holds a charge for a good while under normal use. Am already thinking about replacing the other 2 to the newer generation models. Absolutely will recommend Amazon Kindle FIre to anyone who will listen.

-great for children - Grandson loves this tablet, does everything he needs
-Great for kids - My daughter loves this tablet. Can watch netflix and youtube on the go if u have moblie hotspots or wifi.
-Awesome - Excellent for kids. Great warranty and cool features!!
-Love this tablet - I always wanted a tablet and finally decided on the amazon fire 8. It is awesome and I love it.I downloaded some games and I am enjoying them. It is great for internet too. Definitely worth the price. You get a lot for the money. It had lots more options too.
-Grandson loves this game - I love the learning games that he doesn't even realize they are learning games
-Confusing for me; returning - I ordered this online on black Friday, I live about 30 miles from nearest store and I saw the special on their website, so why not I thought. Came in yesterday. Maybe it's just because I'm not familiar with this product; I'm used to Android tablets that have you set up with your Google account. This one you set up with your Amazon account. OK, no big deal I thought, at first. Then I found it very difficult to install the free 6 month Webroot it came with. I went to Google Play as instructed, it says installed, but there is no Open button to click to continue the process, as instructed. When I contacted Amazon customer support, I was told I can't use Google Play on it and to use the app store instead. I was given a link for Webroot installation but it didn't help. I downloaded Google Chrome but can't find it on the device. No youtube, facebook, gmail apps; won't install. Again, maybe I'm just not used to the product but if I can't use Google apps on it, I won't like this. It's actually for my son and even though teens are often smarter than we adults when it comes to gadgets, LOL, I don't think he will like this either. So I'm returning this; hopefully can find an Android tablet I like (and affordable) at Best Buy.
-Perfect - Perfect for what I need to use it for movies etc great for a gift
-Great Value! - This is a great little phone. It feels like a true moto phone. I like the pure experience of the software. While it's not on par with the $600+ phones... Dollar for dollar, it is well worth the cost. Definitely a good buy.
-MY AMAZON FIRE ROCKS - I HAVE BEEN WITH AMAZON PRIME FOR 2 YEARS AND THIS NEW FIRE HD MAKES IT WORTH IT. i WATCH MOVIES WHEN I FLY BECAUSE I CAN DOWNLOAD THEM. THE BATTERY LAST FOR DAYS. I USE IT EVERYDAY NOW.
-Great and simple to use for anyone. - My mom loves it for reading. My mom is not tech savvy but she was able to adapt pretty quickly.
-My grand child loves it! - Grand child loves it, before she had to look at her favorite movies. On the computer monitor,Now she can look at her movies anywhere.
-durable and fun tablet for kids - I bought this for my 5 yr old granddaughter. She loves it. It has many games and other games can be downloaded. She is also able to watch videos and mom can set parental controls to limit time and usage.

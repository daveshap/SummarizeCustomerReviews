Great for kids - Was ok till it fell off table landed flat face down the broke screen my granddaughter threw unit and didn't break but it fell then broke so what good is bumper on unit if that happens
-It's a great tablet for kids - I been having this for awhile now for my two boys and they just absolutely love it
-Great gift for My Granddaughter - I hope that Azi will like to have her own entertainment instead of playing games on the cell phone.
-Perfect for my 8 year old! - I love how kid friendly this tablet is. I also love the parental controls. I am able to supervise everything he's doing and he is still able to play the games and watch the videos he loves. It's even easy enough for his 3 year old sister to use. Great product! Glad I purchased this and saved money instead of getting an Ipad or Samsung. Much better choice.
-Love it! - Simple and easy to use!! The wife takes it everywhere!
-Nice - It?Js super big, buys it?Js really clear, sound is good
-A Good Price and Great Value - This is a good product at a great price if you are needing a tablet for web surfing.
-Tablet will not charge - The tablet works great when the battery is charged. The problem we have is the provided charging cable connector does not seat well into the tablet's micro USB port and does not have a solid electrical connection. Therefore, most of the time the tablet sits useless with a dead battery.
-Good budget tablet - It's good budget tablet for someone who wants to use light apps, video streaming, and internet.1.5gb ram is enough for most apps.16g memory and sd card slot gives enough space.
-Great device for kids - I love it so and so my kids.They r enjoying playing the educational games, and watching cartoons.
-Great - I love my Kindle fire. Had a Kindle and it disappeared. Enjoy not having to go to library for books. I get a great selection of books every day.
-Great for kids - Was a gift for our 8 year old daughter. Great for kids
-Very competitive with iPad to the touch - Great item, I can say it feel just like working with an iPad. Picture, sound, size and touch are very sweet.
-Great Tablet for Kids - Great tablet, kids love it and have their own. Easy to use
-False advertising?? - Received the Amazon Fire HD8 and it works well, BUT it is clogged up with constant ads. I had to contact Amazon to turn them off, at an additional cost of $15+tax.. When promoting this item at this price, it should have a notice that the price is discounted by the inclusion of constant ads!
-great kids tablet - love the worry free guarantee since this has been dropped several times. with that being said this tablet hs held up
-Good for the price - It was a good gift for the price and had many features and options
-Great - Great bang for your buck. Great for taking to meetings.
-great for young kids - My 3 year old grand child is loving this tablet. She is really catching on to using technology . She loves this and plays a lot of educational things that was available to her.
-Excellent - Perfect for my 9-yr old....small enough to tuck into a bag easily & very easy to use...perfect price point for no worries & has been great!!
-Works well - The Kindle Fire works well and I enjoy reading on it. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it seems silly to restrict people from reading Nook books on it just because it is a different platform. As a book lover, I like supporting bookstores not only the almighty Amazon. Yes, I know there are ways to get around the restriction. The reason to reduce a point is not based on the excellence of this Kindle, but on politics of sharing.
-Works fine - I exchanged a highly unsatisfactory Insignia unit for the Fire. I was looking for a 10 inch screen, but went to the smaller size for performance. I have no complaints with the Amazon product, other than the ubiquitous advertising.
-Great amazon fire - I love this and it's great for kids got it for a early Christmas gift for a friends son and he loves it
-Great Gift - Great gift idea for that book worm in the house. Very easy to use
-Solid tablet! - This tablet is great for my son. Would be nice if it had a little more horsepower

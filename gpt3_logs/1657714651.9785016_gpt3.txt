-Easy to hold and use. - Great price for a Kindle Fire. Lightweight, easy to hold and use.
-Not what I was looking for - I purchased this for my 4 year old to play. It was not as user friendly as described and VERY slow. It keeps pausing and freezing up, which is frustrating for anyone using it. I was told that I would receive 20 off of the prime subscription, however, that was not offered when registering this product. It may be good for some, but it was not a good fit for us.
-Great tablet for all ages - Had a kindle fire for 5years and just got the new one we use it all the time
-good for kids - my kid loves it of course. I haven't had a chance to look at it's potential for parent use, like email. Seems like a winner.
-Easy to use - The tablet is easy to use, The storage isn't great but you can add a card for extra storage which is nice. Haven't found any problems with it yet. Reasonably price.
-Pleased - This is a reliable brand and a good product for price.
-Great basic tablet, best with Prime subscription - Great tablet for the cost, does all the basic functions great. These are email, web surfing, and social media. If you belong to Amazon Prime then it's even better since this thing makes it easy to take advantage of the extra content you can access. Movies, TV Shows, music, books. A lot of this is free for Prime Members. Good idea and business move for Amazon as it encourages Amazon content and purchases. The tablet itself is pretty good, smaller and more narrow than an iPad. Easy to hold in one hand, screen is nice for video, reading, web surfing and email. If the iPad is setting the bar and is a 10, I would give this an 7-8. The weakest thing is the camera, it adequate but you smart phone is better. A feature it has that the iPad lacks is the ability to add an Micro SD Card for extra space. It is also much cheaper than an iPad.
-A lot for a little - Great speed and function for a small price. Does what I needed.
-Lovely Tablet - Kid friendly Great appsChild can learn many things with this tablet
-Perfect for kids - My mom bought the tablets first for my sisters for Christmas an then my 4 year old wanted one so I purchased one for her. She loves it uses it for games, Netflix, an she is home school so she is able to do her work on the tablet as well

Great for kids - My kids love this tablet! Good for those long road trips.
-Bought for Senior and Preteen - I bought two of these kindles. One for my preteen granddaughter whom had no problem at all being up and running. However, My senior mother found that the touch screen was not sensitive enough for the menu to drop easily for her. As a first time user on the kindle fire my mom will take time getting used to it. However, my tech savvy granddaughter loves her already.
-Love that they come in colors - Great product for my kids, hours of entertainment!
-Love it - Love it will recommend it to my friends.Found it to be as good as having a I pad.You can take good photos and face time as well as text.A vary llite tablet that comes in a number of colors.You can also use it out doors because it has a polarizing filter.
-Great buy - My kids got this to replace their Ipads and haven't missed a beat.
-Kindle Fire great for reading - Can carry a ton a of books around with ease and read any where
-Beginner tablet - it has great durability, but lacks great sound. The picture quality is just ok
-Frees up parents phones - Can download games without using phone plan data. Games that my boys enjoy
-Works well - I bought it Xmas for my 4 yr old who always wants our iPhones to watch utube videos. It's cool looking and well made plus Alexa is helpful. It she still prefers our iPhones because the touch screen makes it a bit easier to stop her video and is more sensitive. I like it but don't live it.
-Great tablet for kids - My kids love this product it keeps them busy anytime of day
-Great budget tablet - Bought it on black Friday for 60$ .Value for money tablet. It lags at heavy tasks and also apps are reloaded when 2-3 apps are opened at same time. But at this price it is expected. Go for it if budget is <100$.
-my son loves it... - Pretty sure he is probably playing angry birds with it now.
-Good For the Price / Play games and Watch Movies - My kids watch movies in the car, I link in with my mobile device and share my unlimited internet with both tablets. I have set up hulu / netflix on both accounts and they have tons of hrs of movies and shows. Amaxzon also gives you a 1 year subscription to games. And worry free 2 years replacement guarantee!!!!!
-Great tablet for the little ones - My granddaughter is really enjoying this tablet and even though she is only three she is able to easily use it
-Great tablet for kids! - Bought one of these for each of my grandkids and they love it!
-Not Horrible - Well not as good as I thought but works fine for my children.
-Great Tablet - Kids loved these tablets, and in not worried about them dropping them
-Great - Absolute best for kids. Bought three for ages toddler to teen and it's perfect for each.
-Great budget tablet - Bought it on black Friday for 60$ .Value for money tablet. It lags at heavy tasks and also apps are reloaded when 2-3 apps are opened at same time. But at this price it is expected. Go for it if budget is <100$.
-Great Value - This device performs great! For the price it's really a steal. Affordable and easy to use.
-great tablet - good value for the money, love the kindle for reading
-Easy to read with Fire - The Fire makes easy reading. I also love the internet capabilities and the apps that I can access with ease. The horizontal book format for reading makes it even better to read through each book. I receive my emails quickly wherever I may be, as long as I am connected to wifi. I would recommend the Fire to anyone. And the personnel at the Beat Buy store were very knowledgeable about this product and helped me a great deal through the buying process.
-Fantastic Tablet for kids - I bought this for my grand daughter when she comes over to visit. I set it up with her as the user, entered her age and name and now Amazon makes sure that she only accesses sites and content that are appropriate to her age. Simple to do and she loves the capabilities. I also bought and installed a 64gig SD card which gives this little tablet plenty of storage. For the price I think this tablet is best one out there. You can spend hundreds of dollars more for additional speed and capacity but when it comes to the basics this tablets does everything that most people will ever need at a fraction of the cost.
-A Solid Basic Tablet - I purchased this tablet knowing exactly what my needs were and how well the Kindle could meet them. Despite the "walled garden" philosophy that tethers you mostly to Amazon products and services, the ability (as of right now) to side-load the Google Play Store makes this a surprisingly versatile device for the price point.
-great table for a child to begin witturdy - We gave this tablet to our nine year old Grandaughter for her birthday. She loves it and we feel it is very sturdy. That is a very good thing when it comes to tablets and children.

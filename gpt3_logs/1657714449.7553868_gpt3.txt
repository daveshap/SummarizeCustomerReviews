-Awesome tablet for my nephew! - My soon to be wife and I decided to buy the tablet for our nephew for his birthday and he's in love with it. He's able to watch youtube and play games on it, doesn't hiccup or lag at all. A huge plus for me is the protective case it came with. With it being on sale at the time for around $100 for a 32GB tablet - that was a no brainer. Definitely worth every penny.

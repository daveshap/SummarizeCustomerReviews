Write a detailed summary of the following product reviews. What are the key features that people love and hate about this product?


Amazon Fire - If you need a basic tablet then the fire works. It falls apart when compared to the iPad mini from a usability, functionality and available apps standpoint.
Fire HD 8 Color Orange - The screen is great on the Fire HD 8. This tablet was given to a child and she loves the tablet. The only thing I don't like about the whole Amazon experience is the advertisement. Other than that, the tablet is nice.
Not bad but it?Js very slow - Not really impressed by this item. It is pretty slow.
Good tablet for the price - I bought this tablet mostly for watching movies. I downloaded movies from Netflix and watch them during indoor bike training at the gym. I love the ability to expand the memory with a microSD card, which iPads do not. It's pretty fast and has all the features I need. I read kindle books with it as well. The drawback is that some apps are not compatible with this device. The iPad is definitely more powerful and compatible with many apps I use, but this is a great tablet for most of my current interests.
Great gift!!! - Awseome tablet for kids. I would recommend this tablet for all age groups.
Very Happy Granddaughter - This was a gift for my 5 year old granddaughter and she loves loves loves it!!!
Great for toddlers - Perfect..grandson, age 16 months, just loves it! No worries if dropped.
Compact computer - Great for taking on trips. 16 GB, camera, computer
Great tablet - This is a great tablet for the price. I have one that I purchased a few years ago and use it much more than my laptop. Recently purchased two more for gifts.
User friendly - I purchased the Kids kindle because of the warranty plan. Thinking it's the best deal for the money. I find it in no way user friendly for my ha me or my 3 year old granddaughter! She can take my iPad go strength to her folder.
Apps are great for my daughter - Have a special needs daughter who needs a tablet that is durable along with fun apps she can enjoy without having her mom checking on where she is surfing on the internet. Very entertaining without having her wonder on various apps.
Excellent tablet for children - I bought this for my granddaughter who is 2 and was able to load all the apps and books as well as her Disney movies. So far she has been unable to access anything that I don't want her to. And it has been able to withstand frequent toddler abuse.. Aka.. Throwing it. Definitely recommend.
childrens kindle - great learning tool for my granddaughter. she loves it.
My Granddaughter loves her Amazon Kendall fire - Excellent tablet for a young child that is very durable, expandable, inexpensive and my grand daughter loves it.
Loving It - I love my new Amazon Fire! I was very easy to use..
Great educational tool - My 2 year old granddaughter loves her Amazon kids edition. It's amazing how she knows how to get to her favorite educational program. I live the color pink case very sturdy
Great tablet for kids - It's great for my 7 year old. Easy for her to use.
good portable device - my opinion its a good option for the cost. Not as great as Apple Ipad, but it costs so much less. Still can get good use
Love it - I love new Kindle Fire. I love the convenience having books with me all the time being able to have an entire library at my fingertips.
Great tablet - Great product, for a very good price! Loved this tablet
Great! - Bought this tablet for my son and he has loved it. It's so easy for him to use and easy for me to set parental controls.
Absolutely great - I bought this for my wife and she absolutely loves this device .
Amazon - Fire Kids Edition - This is a great tablet. Power connector could be better.
Great black friday price for this tablet - I purchased this on Black Friday because I could pass on the price. The tablet works great for basic internet needs and great for shopping on Amazon. If I were to purchase another Android Tablet, I will look for something with a little more power since this tablet slows when multi-tasking.
Great product - The tablet is very light and streams well. I only use it to stream movies and it's much ligher then an iPad so makes mobility that much better.

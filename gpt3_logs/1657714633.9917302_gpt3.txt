Great reasonably priced tablet. - My mom was looking for a affordable tablet. I bought mine at best buy last November. I recommended the fire tablet and she loves it.
-Great for low tech hubby - I bought the Amazon Fire HD 8 for my husband for Christmas. He's never too excited about gifts but he is using this tablet every day and even though he won't admit it, he absolutely loves it. Would definitely buy again, especially during Black Friday specials.
-Kindle 2nd - I bought this second Kindle for the larger storage space and love all the extra stuff I can do now.
-great - great table for kids and parents control great gre
-Processor is slow - My toddler did not like this tablet. It was a bit slow for her. Instead, she preferred an iPad over the Kindle Kids version.

-On Fire - A Christmas gift for my granddaughter. It was a big hit!
-Agreat gift for the grandkids - The grandkids love it they spend time playing the games they like.
-Best value for a tablet - Love the tablet mainly use for games and internet. Grrat product foe the price.
-Perfect Gift for kids - I bought this for my 8 year olds birthday. It is perfect and all 4 kids have their own profile so there is no fighting. The parental controls are awesome, we set daily limits for them, but then they want to share with each other when one is done with their time. We love it.
-Kindle - This is really nice and has great clarity I like it.
-Great tablet for all ages! - My husband has never had a smartphone or touch screen laptop or tablet. The Fire HD was easy for him to set up and learn how to use.He loves it and is very pleased!
-Amazing Tablet with an Amazing Price - Loved the product. First I was disappointed that I could not download Google Store apps but a Quick Google Search fixed that Issue and now I can download any Google Store Apps. The Battery Life is amazing as I was able to Watch around 4 Full Movies on a Single Charge. Performance is great as Games like Marvel Champions Modern Strike Online had no issues. Able to add an SD Card is just perfect as I dont have to worry about Storage for downloading Movies or Apps. Speakers are better then my Samsung Galaxy S7. For the Price point of this Tablet there is not a single thing to Complain. If I have to Brightness of the Screen can be better.
-great size - nice size, very clear but randomly shuts off. cant remove unwanted apps from the home screen. if you watch video..it buffers alot and laggs.
-parent control, 2 year warranty, free down loads - i bought 2 for a 3 and 4 year old grand-babies and its so easy to use for both of us.
-Great budget tablet - This tablet was great. I bought it for my sister on christmas and she loves it. It is great for surfing the web and watching videos.
-Kindle upgrade - Gave this to my wife for Christmas. Upgraded from the original Kindle. She thoroughly enjoys it.
-Great Tablet - I love this Kindle and bought it for the upgrades to replace my original kindle fire. I would give it an excellent rating if the camera were better but the pictures come out grainy and not very clear. Great for watching shows and videos and these are very clear.. Love playing games on it and of course reading the latest books.

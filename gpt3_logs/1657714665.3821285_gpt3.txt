Great for the price and the kids - Your can really control what your kid gets access to from apps, videos, and the Internet. You can not get a better deal. The 2 yr anything happens warranty is a big plus. It's not the fastest thing on the market it's desent. Picture quality is great. Everything that comes with it just makes it a real smart buy. Love the fact that I can program it to have her read 15mins 1st before she can fully access it. Also that I can put a time limit on what she can access and for how long for the week.
-Great Tablet for a Toddler - I bought this Amazon Fire HD Tablet for my 3 yr. old grandson for Christmas. It has been keeping him occupied with so many educational activities and games!
-Great to help with young readers - My Goddaughter love playing games on my tablet and watching her shows. Not we can load her favorite books and shows on her on tablet.
-Has everything you need - This has a great picture, good size, lots of storage and a camera. Would recommend
-Touch response is not good - Touch response is not so good. so my kid refused to play games on this.Returned this product. Thanks to Bestbuy for the full refund
-Powerful, but not easy to use - Easy to access the apps, but not always easy to quit. The device works good, but since it's the apps that make it what it is, more attention should be given to their operation. I was disappointed that it did not come with even a basic user's guide.
-nice tablet - if you like the old kindle fire it just like the new one but better, better screen and more space

-Great tablet for a small child - Bought it for my 4 year old and he loves it! The child case is awesome too in case of any drops.
-Great basic kindle - Just a simple kindle. Doesn't have the glass back.
-Kid's Kindle - I bought this Kindle for my 7 year old grand-daughter. I bought a warranty for it. I bought it in August, I have already had to replace it. The charger connection got loose and was not charging. Well, it has happened again. I will need to exchange it again. The problem is that I have to buy the warranty each time. I was going to buy one for her brothers and sister, but I am now rethinking that.
-works great, but..... - the tablet is great, but all the advertising is annoying
-Good for the price - Screen is good . Lack of Google play kinda hurts but you will survive. The issue of back buttons or multifunction buttons is that sometime they don't appear when you need them.. as they are part of the screen . So you have to kinda summons them which is a pain
-Excellent - For the price this is a great investment. With amazon prime it becomes loads of fun
-Great tablet for reading with internet options. - Great tablet for reading and game play. Color is great.
-Terrible - I bought this because I have ebooks in college. Not only could I not get my ebook. I called the school IT department. They could not either. My semester was already started. The sales representative at the store told me this is what I needed. I ended up buying a tablet from my phone carrier and my ebooks were right there in less than 5 minutes with the schools IT department help.

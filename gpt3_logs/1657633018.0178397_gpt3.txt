excellebt tablet - this tablet is excellent i use it on the couch inthe bedroom and in the car too i simplty love it
Great Product - It was the best Christmas Present for my grandson.
Very nice tablet - I really like the Fire IS 8 16gb, it is fast and smooth.
Good tablet and was very skeptical, great choice - We originally owned an original kindle but it was slow app store was not the best and overall interface was to be desired. In fact eventually the device crashed and couldn't be recovered with limited use. Deeply debated about getting another and actually bought a Samsung tablet, but it was too small. This was such a good deal it was hard to ignore and have been very happy to give another try. This device is a great size and much better interface. Would buy again and will consider in the future for the kids.
Great entry level tablet - Cannot beat the price. Beautiful screen, durable materials. Extra bonus for prime users is Amazon Prime music and video library. Fits a great niche for ultra-portable needs. For music, I pare it with my Oonz portable speaker for great sound.
Excellent buying experience - This is my 2nd tablet. Kindle Fire hd 8 reviewed throughly elsewhere many times for its solid performance for money. I mainly wanna talk about excellent buying experience at local best buy. It was not in Stock but employee we extra miles to locate the stock somewhe re but I like my local store much so ended up ordering there. Keep up the good work !. Very pleasant buying experience.
Ok - The Freetime so far isn't very intuitive and it looks like you have to be on the deivce. No web interface for it.
Quality device - Great tablet for a low cost. Dependable and with all the Right Software.
Too many Amazon amps - Prefer no amps on unit and just allow buyer to place the amps they want or will ever use.
Good buy - Purchased for my god daughter as a gift easy to use would recommend this product for young and old
visuals - I like the fire tablet it's very easy to use and visuals are very good.
Good tablet - My grandkids love's it always on it great learning tool
Good tablet for the price range - Will buy this product at this price range again if needed.
Great product - We love the free time feature. Definitely going to end up subscribing after the free year trial is up. Our 2 year old loves it and we can control how long she's on it.
love it - easy to use. nice sides and easy to read ,, also very easy to load
A good starter but not for the impatient - My kids have grown up with technology in the house and their original tablets have started to become outdated. We have since switched to these fire tablets to help extend their gaming. While if they have never had a tablet before the speeds are OK but Im afraid the processing power of these "kids" versions might lag over a short amount of time and they will just become a picture viewer. Time will only tell.
Christmas gift - Think this will be a great product for my parents it is a Christmas gift.
Easy to use - Does a lot more than old tablet.It Hasmore memory.
Not just a toy - Child loves it. Can be used for more than just a time killer. Can learn from it.
Amazon fire HD8 - Perfect for the price. It is great to bring with you on the go. And like I said can't beat the price. The only con is it has a plastic back so be careful. The battery is great. I would absolutely recommend this product.
Great for younger kids - Got this for my 8 year old granddaughter and she loves it. Uses it for game play, homework, etc. Mom and Dad loves the parental controls. Not having to worry so much.
Husband's - Bought this for my husband. He has really enjoyed it.
Purchase for a gift - I would recommend this tablet because of the value
Works just fine. Faster than the old one! - It's not a $400.00 tablet so what can you expect, except that it does what it's suppose to. It's faster than I thought it would be so thats killer.
Amazon Fire - Good deal from Black Friday sales and will make a very good Christmas gift. Kids edition excellent with the rubber bumper case which provides pretty good protection.

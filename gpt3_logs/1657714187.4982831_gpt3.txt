It is a shopping device - If you shop on Amazon all the time, this will help make it easier still. Lots of ads pop up, and you can't use apps from non-Amazon sources unless you root it, and that is complicated. This is not a realistic alternative to an iPad or Galaxy Note. If you just want to a device to shop on Amazon with, you'll love it.
-Not a bad tablet - It takes a little getting used to if you are used to Android
-Great tablet for the price - Awesome tablet! Super quick, great picture, and overall great quality
-Great kindle for kids - This is a great kindle for kids to use as it is very user friendly and once they get the hang of it they will not put it down.
-Great - Great tablet fast screen good size never gives me problem
-Perfect for a child - I own 3 Kindles. They are my favorite hand held technology so it was an easy decision to buy my great niece one for her birthday. The case helps make it even more sturdy so it can stand up to being dropped more often than an adult would. It's easy to use and she loves it.
-Easy to use - Bought this for my young granddaughter. It is so easy for her to use. We can control the content. She is learning her colors and alphabet with the help of this tablet. Lots of free content. It was easy to connect to the home wifi. Great battery life.
-Love it! - I bought this for reading but love the extras. Works great! Great reading options.
-Good for readers - Bought for reading Kindle books. Large selection of books.
-Good hardware, bad software - The built quality is great taking into considerarions its price. The tablet is pretty fast and responsive. However, Amazon's operating system is horrible. I miss a lot of apps that I use in my Apple devices, and some others that just don't work as good such as Mint and Netflix (don't have download capability). Also it won't work with my Chromecast devices...
-Great for a kid. - Grandkids and adult parents love it. The parents texted and the grandkids play games.
-Great for Reading - Great for reading books, but I having to manually update the apps is a pain.
-Good buy for the price - I previously owned the Fire HD 7 and was excited about the HD 8. After getting the HD 8 and using it I started to notice how they were able to cut costs. The screen was not as crisp, the processor was slower and the speakers were not as loud as previous versions. Overall a good buy for the price but if you are expecting the quality that went into previous versions look elsewhere.
-Nice - Was a great upgrade from my kindle fire. Much clearer and still lightweight
-Great Tablet - Amazon Fire HD8 is great for browsing and reading. GPS system not that great though.
-Good - It is an amazon amazing among many things that can be used by many people and always will be a good product to use for many people to tryout and have an important experience for their family. Amazon Kindle fire 16gb with side that has slot for the extra memory in the form of a memory chip.
-Great tablet - I was surprised on how easy it was to use. I bought it for my mother and she totally loves it, and I do too!
-Great - It was easy to set up and use. Best Buy employees were a huge help teaching me about the many features.
-great kindle for kids - this kindle is great especially for the free time app my son loves it
-PERFECT! - We are a total Apple family so I was a little hesitant to purchase this when our iPad stopped working. So glad we did because it's perfect and can't beat it for the price!
-Love it - I traded this in after receiving a 7" at Christmas and I am happy I did. I love the size of the screen for reading my books (which I have too many of) and a great size for watching movies. I do wish I had the capability to use internet when I am away from home, yet other than that, this is a great buy.
-Think it is a good product - It's a mini computer packed in a handheld devise. Applications load quickly and I am able to get my work completed, while riding the commuter rail.
-I like the bigger screen. - My grandkids play on my smaller one. Thought I better get a back up for me.
-Great Tablet - I bought 3 tablets and my family was not disappointed.
-My 3 yr old grandson loves it! - My grandson really enjoys this tablet, ease of use and lots of different educational programs. Must remember to charge tablet everynight.

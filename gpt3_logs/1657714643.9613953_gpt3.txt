List all of the unique points that customers say about this product. We want to focus on strengths, weaknesses, and improvements.


Tablet works pretty good, just getting started. - I know many people who have a kindle. It frees up using the cell phone memory, so I bought this one for the amount of storage it has, as well as the cost of the item. Thank you.
-Good buy - I bought it for my 2 (almost 3) year old. He really lover it. I love that I can put a timer on it and he can't be on it all day. It's easy to use. The only thing I hate is how fast the battery runs down even if not in use.
-Kindle for grandchild - I've bought several kindles for my grandkids they all enjoy them we use it for the library and download into overdrive and there are so many free games kids love this
-Nice tablet - My son love it. He always play using this and no problem at all.
-Free Tablet - Works good, has very nice screen brightness and resolution
-Great tablet for mom - Mom likes this allot, once she started using it. She was hesitant at first because it's something new! But that didn't last long.
-Good tablet - This Fire tablet is overall a good size, and has great features!
-Love this for my 2 yr old. - This thing has it all...even the cartoons that my older kids watched. Plenty of activities and teaching. 5 stars

-Kindle for grandchild - I've bought several kindles for my grandkids they all enjoy them we use it for the library and download into overdrive and there are so many free games kids love this
-Perfect for my kids - My kids have enjoyed using this device. They have downloaded games and shows.
-great for reading ebook - should have bought 2 at the sale price, fast, decent graphics great for reading ebooks best of fits in wife's purse
-Wonderful tablet for any age. - Bought the Kindle Fire Kids edition for my daughter. Very easy to install and download several varieties of apps and books and music and photos to customize to her interests. Very well built and easy to use. Compared to several other brands we have purchased this is by far the greater option.
-Love it!!! - This was a replacement for another fire. It's the best tablet we've had and does everything we need it to.
-You Don't Have to Have and iPad to Enjoy a Tablet. - First, the bad. I hate the advertisements and the fact that you can't access the vast library of Android apps via Google Play. Nevertheless, you can do most of the things on the Internet that you need to while still have access to Amazon Fire-friendly apps that will keep you informed and entertained. The good news is that the HD8 has an expansion slot for a microSD card and increasing storage space is where the Fire HD8 dances all over the iPad. Add in a 128GB microSD card and you'll have tons of room for audiobooks, ebooks, music files, photos, and videos. The HD8 also has Amazon Alexa in case you're looking for automated help to shop or move around from interest online or on your Kindle Fire.It's a good buy - especially if you buy one when they are on sale!
-Replacement for Nabi - This is great for an 8 yr old. She had out grown her Nabi and likes taking pictures this does just the trick. The memory can be extended to hold more pictures. Great tablet.
-Great tablet!! - Works well! We had one of the original fires and it finally died which is why we bought another. Great clarity and better internet also
-Great - I really enjoy my amazon. It is getting easyer to use and I am finding new apps every day.
-My grandson loves it - Sturdy construction, withstands toddlers use or (abuse)
-Decent tablet. - Good tablet althought the availability of apps thru their appstore is limited.
-great 2 year warranty - interface isnt as user friendly as other brands but u get used to it.
-Great for kids or adults - This is a great, easy to use tablet. It's nice because it doesn't have to be "just a kids tablet." I can do what I want to do on there as well. The parental controls are great. The case makes it feel pretty durable. The battery lasts a really long time. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because we can't get all of our apps/games on there because they're not available which is pretty disappointing. One real popular one we can't get is YouTube kids. My son loved that. He was pretty bummed about that. Overall we love the tablet, and would definitely recommend it.
-Amazon is the best - This tablet exceeds its reviews. its easy to use and the screen is great.
-Device is not as rugged as it could be returning - returning for a replacement. It got wet and quite working for a child's device it should be better made.

-Perfect gift - Bought this for my elderly non-tech friendly mom. Because it's so user friendly she's able to navigate it and enjoy its features without assistance.
-Easy to use especially if you are a prime member. - Love the access to films. Easy to read and work with. A Little like an Android. I am used to IPhone apps but this works great once you understand it.
-I expected limitations, I got limitations - I have to say this was not that great a purchase and we will most likely be taking advantage of it's greatest product feature, which is the ability to return it for a full refund. We wanted a smaller tablet for our kids, well this is smaller in every way, options are limited and we have realized that we are better off just letting the kids use our tablet so we can buy the newest one. This thing may go back to the store as soon as tonight.
-Great tablet easy to use - Great tablet for kids to use! Play games or read books and isn't slow.
-Good tablet - Works great prety fast operating system dosent heat up
-Great tablet for children - I previously had bought an older model of these tablets for my children. I wasn't to happy with them. But this tablet is great, it has child safety features like wether you would like to have them surf the web to even limiting the amount of hours your child can use it. Very good tablet for what my kids will use it for which is mostly Netflix Hulu and even though there isn't you tube app there are alternate apps that acces you tube.
-Great tablet for price - Nice tablet for my 8 year old daughter! Affordable! Charging battery can be frustrating at time. Normally have to hit power button to turn off and back on after you plug into outlet to charge or it will take many hours to charge. It is almost like it allows the tablet to reset to charge.
-Makes learning fun. - Purchased for a 3 and 4 yr old grandchild for preschool. Software included will take them many years ahead. Both children just took off with scheduled programs. Very solid instrument easy parental control setup. Best life investment ever. Very happy and so are the kids.
-The camera and Cover are great - Perfect for that age group that I bought it for she 10and loves it.

-Amazon- Fire, grandsons edition - Excellent product. My grandson loves it. Fast, easy to use and yet challenging enough that he is learning at the same time
-Great Device! - I love the size and the HD quality. Just what I was looking for!Downloads apps really fast!
-great tab for kids - I bought this tab as a birthday gift for my 12 yr old nephew who lives in India. It's very useful for him to google for important information over the Internet for his school assignments. Also, he can video chat with me using Skype.Rightly priced to be a kid's product. Resolution could've been better if its targeted as a kid's product. I think better resolution can reduce some pressure on eyes while reading documents with fine text.
-Great Product - Bought this for an older person and it's a simple tablet to use at their age she loves it

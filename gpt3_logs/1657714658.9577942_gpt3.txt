Terrific value - Awesome tablet for beginners and pros for surfing and basics .
-Great for my toddler - My daughter loves her kindle. I swapped out the case for one with a handle so she can carry it but it's perfect for her
-Nice kids tablet - Bought this for my daughter's 4th birthday, I love how easily she can just click and download whatever she wants without bugging me for passwords. The 2 year worry free guarantee is also very nice to have since kids will be kids!
-Good tablet for good price - Bought it for my aunt and she loved it she even told me to buy it for her friend
-Good child tablet - Excellent quality and durability for a young child
-A great starter tablet for a youngster - Santa dropped this off for our 4th grader along with expanded memory. he uses it for Netflix and Youtube as well as Minecraft and other Apps. Why spend hundreds on something for basic kids needs? I'm sure this will last him a few years and is well worth the price.

-Perfect for my 8 year old! - I love how kid friendly this tablet is. I also love the parental controls. I am able to supervise everything he's doing and he is still able to play the games and watch the videos he loves. It's even easy enough for his 3 year old sister to use. Great product! Glad I purchased this and saved money instead of getting an Ipad or Samsung. Much better choice.

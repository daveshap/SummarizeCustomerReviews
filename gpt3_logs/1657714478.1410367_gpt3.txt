Kids love it! - Works great. Easy to set time limits and goals. Easy to set up multiple profiles. Excellent product. As advertised.

-Best Bang For Your Money - Great budget tablet for web browsing. Also useful as an MP3 player and ebook reader.
-Happy with this purchase - I bought this primarily for videos for my son while in the car. I have messed around with it a bit and found the internet connections to be a bit slow. Its to be expected for a tablet at this price point. Overall, I am happy with the product.
-Great Gift for Grandkids! - I bought two of these for my two grandchildren. (A 4 year old boy and a 2 year old girl) So, I bought one in pink and one in blue. We down loaded age appropriate games and they are lifesavers!
-kids love it - It is great if you are a prime member , case is durable!
-Simple tablet - Great for kids. Simple and inexpensive. 16G must better than 8G
-Good - Bought this tablet for my 2 &1/2 year old and it is perfect. Games and videos that come on it are very age appropriate and the tablet has been very durable thus far.
-Works great for what I need for nursing class - This works great for my college class because it's small and compact plus it is very fast. I recommend it. It does what I need for school or just to play games, or enjoy the Amazon apps on the tablet.
-Amazon is on Fire - The Amazon FIre Tablet is awesome. My daughter loves it very much. It is very easy to access and download your apps. The settings functions are very easy to use and program.
-Bought as a gift - Bought this as a gift but was wrong item wanted so wasn't used
-Perfect for Kids!! - purchased for my grandson. He loves it. When setting up be sure to update the software
-Great buy - Overall, not a bad tablet. The price is good and the features are pretty nice. It was bought as a gift and I can say that she loved it.
-Great inexpensive tablet - Bought a Kindle Fire for my wife several years ago, our son is now 9 and he had kind of taken over the tablet from my wife. So we decided he was responsible enough and bought this for him for Christmas. I cannot believe the improvement over the previous Kindle Fire we own. The screen is more clear and bright and even seems more detailed, apps load faster, it connects to the internet faster. For the $89.99 they currently sell for I would say it is an excellent value. If you can wait, we paid less at Christmas so a lower price could be seen again.
-Love it - The kinde was really good and my dauther like it. It is very good product and i would reccomend this to al my firends and family.

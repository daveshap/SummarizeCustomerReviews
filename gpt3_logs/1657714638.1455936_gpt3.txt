Awesome reader - Picture quality is so much nicer than my old reader.
-should have purchased sooner - For a cheaper price this does more than my kindle- love having this tablet
-easy to operatedownloaded alot of books - love it, can do alot of stuff on it, would recommend fire hd8 to everyone
-Great for young users - The tablet is great with many build in games. The only disadvantage is not a lot of storage.
-Ok Tablet for the Price - Got this when it was on sale mainly to get the books not available @ B&N and to play audiobooks. Main drawback: the constant advertising! You turn it on and get a ad. Let it sit for a moment or two, another ad pops up. Ads for nothing I've ever expressed an interest in. Very irritating.Color is very crisp and clean.Love my older Nook but lately B&N doesn't always have the books that are available on Amazon. Will continue to use the Nook as my primary e-reader with the Fire as my primary audiobook player.
-I got this for a gift - We got this for our nephew and he absolutely loves it, very easy for him to use too.
-Very nice - Bought it for my pre-k daughter but my teen-ager daughter took it for a try and she so love it!
-Great Tablet, unbelievable price - I had the previous model which was fine for reading but a little slow for other things. The extra .5 RAM makes a difference. Very happy and if you're a Prime member there are lots of freebies!
-great for reading - this tablet is great for reading the text is not a good as it is on my tab s2 9.7 in but this is about $200 cheaper i got it because i wanted a more natural book feel reading my books and the tab s2 was not doing it for me
-Great tablet for kids - Easy to use tablet for kids. Very durable case. Love it!
-Kindle fire - This kindle fire is great. The kids love it. They can watch shows and play games. Keeps them entertained.
-Very durable - Bought for 4yr old, so older kids would stop saying don't touch that. Comes with durable child case. Large enough to see and hold, but small enough to carry. Easy to use and can download favorite stuff.
-Great kids tablet - I bought this and onother color at the same time. Great item no complaint
-Kid approved. - My 3 year old destroyed an iPad mini. This thing has held up through drops, throws , and sticky fingers. Awesome investment for road trips.
-Simply Awesome. - Compared to all other 7 inch Tablets, this Amazon Fire Tab just outperforms them by miles. And yes you can add the Google Play Store without rooting the device.
-Great value for the price... - Overall I am satisfied with the tablet. Nice looking screen and decent sounding speakers. Loads of content kids and adults. Nice device!
-Nice tablet for a kid - Had to get this tablet it was a great price and came with free amazon movies for a year, I just had to change the case.
-Great Tablet, but it takes over 3 hours to charge - When this item is charged it works great, but it takes too long to charge. Asking my 3 year old to wait about 3 hours (no exaggerating) is a bit much. We have tried to buy a new charger and it still takes just as long. My niece has this same tablet and it take about 45 minutes to charge once it is fully dead
-Our kid loves it. - Great tablet. It came loaded with a lot of good apps just for kids. Our daughter is 2 and she had no problem learning to navigate and use the apps. Also the case keeps the tablet protected and it's pretty tough with good grip. Well worth the money.
-Great Tablet - For the price this is a great tablet. Got it for my wife for Christmas and she loves it.
-It was a Christmas present, so far so good. - I bought it for my grandson for Christmas and so far it has been good. It is him that is the problem. He isn't able to understand some of the stuff but will in time.
-Great value for the price... - Overall I am satisfied with the tablet. Nice looking screen and decent sounding speakers. Loads of content kids and adults. Nice device!
-Good tablet for a good price - I got this tablet for Black Friday at a decent price. It's 8 inches, you can add more space with a micro sd and very easy to use.
-Great tablet for toddlers - Verified PurchaseI got the kids version because this is mainly for my toddler. I know, I know, yes I did get this for my toddler. He is always interested in the learning apps we get on our phone for him so we figured this would be perfect.
-Kids Tablet - Nice product! Would Recommend! Kids love it a lot!!

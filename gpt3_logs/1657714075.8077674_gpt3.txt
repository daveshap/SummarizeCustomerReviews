Nice Tablet - Really enjoying my new tablet. I like to travel and me and my family use it to play game and watch movies. Just the right size to.
-Tablet for the kiddo - Wanted something with a kids mode on it so we could limit time and content. This works. Saw it for a really low price so couldn't resist otherwise we would have gotten the padded kids version.
-Great tablet - I love the tablet....I just can't do without the tabelt
-Love the Fire - We had an old Fire and upgraded to the Fire HD. Love everything about it so far.
-Great buy - This is the second one I've bought for my kids. The each have their own tablet now. As a parent I like that I can set limits...such as screen time, reading, videos etc. You can control everything. It can be educational aswell. Their is alot of educational apps on the device to download. Such as wikipedia,farmers almanac etc. Patents should look through and discover apps with the kids to get full use of the tablet. It continues to update regularly.
-works great! - Works great. I have no complaints with this item. My grandaughter is happy with it.
-Good Reader - I read a huge number of books in Kindle format. This Kindle Fire is perfect for that. It's just the right balance between screen size and easy carrying. It also is great for Audible users (you will want to install a micro SD card, though). You can also use it to watch Netflix and the like, although I don't. As a tablet, it leaves a lot to be desired. If you are looking for a tablet, give this a pass. It has a lot of system lag, and Wifi reception is terrible even in areas where other devices show a strong signal!Also, you should know that you can't access any apps on the Google Play store; it's locked into Amazon. None of that bothers me because like I said, I only use it to read/listen to Kindle books, and this device works perfectly for that. Bottom line: if you just want a Kindle reading platform with some extra functionality, this will work well for you. If you're looking for the full Android tablet experience, look elsewhere.

-Love it - Amazon tablet that links to my amazon prime account so that i can watch all my movies and listen to my music.
-Pretty Neat - Gives a good quality, being that it's a poloroid camera
-great tablet for the price - My old Kindle was not working so good anymore so bought this one on a Black Friday Deal from Best Buy. Price was great. The only problem I had was that at times it did not seem to be charging well or fast. I took it back to Best Buy and they would have replaced it for me but then would have lost all progress in games I had played. The person at Tech Support suggested that I change the plug in "brick". He said that they have had problems with that. I can use the same plug that I use for my iphone and now it charges fine. Glad that it was an easy fix.
-great for young kids - this product is great for kids under 10 years to learn and grow. I like the fact that it is created with kids in mind

-Excellent!!! - Bought this for my 10 year old daughter for Christmas! She LOVES it!!! A great alternative to a pricey iPad Mini!!! She uses it for watching Netflix, YouTube and we use it for homeschool. We are very happy with our purchase!!!
-So improved - My children love these kindles! They are so much better then the 1st ones we had & the price is better as well!

Love a kindle - A little more complicated than my original kindle, but I lIke it.
-Better than ever - Purchased this for my wife during Christmas and got a great deal on it. Compared to the older version that she has this model is faster, brighter, and more convenient with Alexa. I would recommend this product looking for a tablet with lots of features packed in it.
-Great for kids!! - lots of games, love that it has the option to use as a regular tablet, and my kids love the case because it makes it easier to hold and to prop it up when they are listening to books and such! Has parental controls and is all around awesome for kids!!!!
-Best tablet for under 200$ - I am extremely pleased. Fast. Efficient. Reliable.
-Not the greatest for kids - We purchased this tablet for our 5 y ear old since all the other kid-friendly tablets were limited it what they had on them. Something should be changed regarding the port for the charger. The little area with the small bar in it keeps bending to the point, 5 months later it broke off and of course the warranty has ended. I am over tablets. If you can buy it on black Friday for 25.00 bucks or less, it should be that price all year long. So now he has no tablet because I am not sending it out to have someone else's sent back to me..re-furbished. I am very disappointed.
-Bought for my grandchildren - Pros: liked the warranty, liked that it came with a case making it cost less than buying one separately. Cons: One grandchild was too old for the games included on his locked portion. Was hoping I could put games on a particular grandchilds site and lock it so he couldn't download other things. Would recommend this only for very young children.
-good for its range - its good performance and highly recommended to amazon users
-Amazon - Fire Hd8 - 8 - Tablet - 32gb - Purchase was to replace Fire HD 8.9 that was left on a plane (found & return 50 days later). Like this smaller version due to size & it's 3 years newer on the technology side.
-lots of apps and uses - as above but interface is confusing and swipes are sometimes not recognized.
-Great device for kids - I love it for my kids, they r enjoying playing games and watching kids cartoon.
-IN MY VIEW, THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST READING TABLET - GREAT MEMORY,GREAT MOVIES,GREAT READING, GREAT GAMES,DO I HAVE TO SAY MORE
-Excellent Tablet - Very fast tablet. Large screen but can held by 1 hand. Great for movies and videos, as well as candy crush and other resource hogging apps. It starts CC way faster than my LG G3 phone. The display is very clear and crisp. The amazon android modified OS is good once you get used to it. I have one screen containing all apps, and you can put these in groups too. so 1 screen is all you will need. then you have the other panels for Amazon mandated stuff like Prime movies, music, pictures. It's pretty cool compared to my previous Acer 8" tablet with reg Android. Could not easily install Chrome, but I'm getting use to the SILK browser and it will work very well for my needs. Great Tablet and highly recommended.
-Great - I like this Kindle the only this is it does not read the books as good as my older Amazon Kindle Fire.
-Great for beginner - This tablet has been great. Although I recommend getting a memory card so you have no storage issues!
-Fair - The layout of the tablet is good. Internet is terrible.
-Awesome Kid's Tablet - Great tablet for my 3 yr old. Love the profile options and parental controls!
-Very good price for the quality of the product - Great tablet for the kids to play games and watch shows.
-Great for kids! - Bought for my kid, it's great for him, the apps are good, the free time, bumper and warranty make it worry free!
-Love it - Tablet is for my 2 year old son and it has great learning game so for him! He's learning to read and so much more!
-Niece's gift - Wonderful gift for my niece.She gets entertainment and also gets to use it to learn things.
-Easy to use, full of great apps - Easy to use, easy apps and books, you can use a timer to schedule time use
-Kindle Rocks - I love the Amazon Kindle Fire. I've had one for a couple years, so we bought one for our granddaughter. Can't wait to see her dive in.
-Great price but beware - not all apps work - I bought 50 of these to use in a school education program. The workers at Best Buy assured me the apps I needed them to run would work fine. Unfortunately I was not aware that Amazon has it's own app store unrelated to Apple and GogglePlay. Make sure whatever apps you want to run are also available on the Amazone app store as not all are. Specifically they block anything related to Goggle. Other than that the tablet is great and is a great price and really nice case.
-Great tablet - They just keep getting better. This is great for the beginner or pro
-Great tablet - For the money the Kindle Fire is the best tablet on the market. I wish I didn't buy my I pad already I would have got one of these for myself.


Detailed summary of the key strengths and weaknesses of this product:

==========

The Amazon Kindle Fire is a great tablet for the price. It is fast, has a large screen, and comes with a case. However, it is not the best tablet for kids. It does not have parental controls and the charger port is not very durable.

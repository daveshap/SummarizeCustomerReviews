Perfect for my uses and can't beat the price - I wanted a tablet mainly to keep by my chair so I could look up stuff, such as information about movies I watch on TV, or answers to the New York Times crossword puzzle, or anything else I was curious about. I didn't want to spend much money, but was still dubious whether such an inexpensive tablet could be any good. I decided that for a measly fifty bucks (plus $20 for extra storage), it was worth a shot. I found that it's perfect for my purposes - relatively fast and easy to use. I haven't used it for downloading or the like, but my guess is it'll be OK there, too. I'm happy I bought it.
-Great tablet for children - Bought for my granddaughter for Christmas and she loves it. She would use her Mom's phone to watch her shows but now that she has her tablet she can watch her own and see it much better. Homerun on this Christmas present!
-Great product - Bought this fire for my wife to replace one which got accidently broken.great
-Very Good Tablet for the Money - I bought the Fire HD 8 & CaseI use it mostly for class..works very good..would be better if it had BlueTooth.
-Great fun great device for kids - My grandson loves the Fire 8 Kids. It is durable, and doesn?Jt mind being dropped by little hands. His mind stays engaged and car rides are pleasurable once again!
-Great value for price - Picture is great. Quick response when going from site to site. Sound is not so good but what I expected from a tablet.
-Enjoy - I enjoy my Kindle immensely, so much better than having to start up my computer.
-It is perfect for a first tablet! - I love this tablet! I was not sure if I would like the screen size but it is just fine.
-Great Fire ! - I love all the different options this tablet has...camera is out standing...user guide helps u when ever you need it...easy to handle...my brother plans on getting one real soon...I've told everyone at work what a great tablet the Fire HD8 is.
-Amazing! - I didn't expect anything less than what I got with this Kindle.
-Great Buy - THESE TABLETS ARE PERFECT FOR TODDLERS! I WAS PLANING TO BUY MY 5 AND 3 YEARS OLD AN IPAD BUT CAME ACROSS THESE AND AFTER READING REVIEWS I DECIDED TO ORDER. THE COVERS WORK GREAT SINCE MY 3 YEAR OLD ALWAYS DROPS IT. TOTALLY RECOMMEND!!!
-Durable tablet for 3 year okd - Good tablet durable lots of apps just right for 3 year old
-Perfect for streaming movies - Use this on flights to watch movies and pass the time!
-HOOKED on my Fire 8HD - I've owned a couple iPads, three Samsung Galaxy Tabs, and I can without question say that this Fire 8HD is my favorite out of all. The 16Gig version is all you need. Why? Becuase the micro-sd card expands to 256 gig and the programs can be installed to the external drive...saving the valuable internal for the operating system. Samsung should do the same...if they did, I'd probably wouldn't have bought the Fire, but I'm so glad I did!! Love, love, love it!!

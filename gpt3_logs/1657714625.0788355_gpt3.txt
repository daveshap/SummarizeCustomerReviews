-Great device for kids - I love it so and so my kids.They r enjoying playing the educational games, and watching cartoons.
-great tablet - this tablet is perfect for surfing the internet and following social media
-Great tablet for the money! You won't regret it! - This is my second Kindle and I am really enjoying it. I purchased mainly to use as a reader but it has exceeded my expectations. I can check my emails, surf the web, down loaded fb and pintrest as well. I have linked to my local library and can borrow books with ease. I have also downloaded Netflix as well. I love that I can change it to night reading so there is not so much of a strain on my eyes. I have not charged it for 2days now and have done quite a bit of reading and still showing 53%after 2 days. I purchased the 16g but plan on purchasing a micro SD card so I can expand the memory to download audio books as well.
-Kids need credit card? - Bought this for my young son, because of the warranty. You are required to have a credit card stored in the account, and to turn on parental controls it blocks other features too like Alexa. This is the most ridiculous setup ever.
-Great investment - I'm so glad i brought this because it is very handy and easy to use too. Everything about it is good and I really like it.
-Great Tablet for young child - I bought two of these for my granddaughters and they are very easy to use and they love them.
-Amazing value! - My wife bought the 7" version for reading. After seeing how easy it was to add movies on an SD card I bought this one for myself.
-Love this device - Nice size, easy to use, Blue Shade a great feature
-Not for overseas! - I baught 2 for my kids, and figured that with the cover the the one year of freetime which includes all the videos, apps and games then it makes sense. I baught this one as a gift for a kid overseas, and all the content is not playing, when I contacted amazon, they said it's not for overseas, although I asked in Best Buy before I buy it and they assured me it works everywhere. It's totally overpriced for a tablet that doesn't play anything! Best Buy should know and let customers know specially when u ask specifically!
-Doesn't work for me - This is my 4th Kindle, and the worst so far. It randomly locks up and require a restart to do anything. I've probably had to do this a dozen times in the last week. It's going back if they'll take it.
-Yes - Very nice tablet I like the size of it too nice for a young person
-Great tablet - I was surprised on how easy it was to use. I bought it for my mother and she totally loves it, and I do too!
-Okay. - Very difficult to connect to You Tube. Very frustrating
-Slim and quick - nice slim design, easy to hold, easy to set up. bought for my husband...he just likes to browse the internet. great for him!
-Amazing! - I didn't expect anything less than what I got with this Kindle.
-Great tablet for the price - these tablets work wonders for my needs, i didnt need a tablet to work, only for web browsing and play some games. nothing fancy, this tablet fits perfectly for that. and the price...pff perfect. ! you wont find this quality cheaper.
-Tablet for children - I think the tablet is great it's plenty apps and books for children to read and interact with I also like the option that they don't just have books that you read yourself you can choose one that would read to you the tablet is just a good all-around Device it allows you to add additional apps that you would purchase separate to it
-Great tablet - Santa got this for my 7year old. Work's great . He plays, games, gets on hulu, and can play his school education learning games. Now he doesn't bother me to use my electronic devices .
-Eventually a good buy. - 3 yr old loves it, I hate it. Hours spent download
-great for reading books - links up with up local library. good to read in sunlight. can check web and emails. close to having a tablet but have to figure out what apps work with amazon.
-Good - Good for pleasure not for work. But good value for what you pay.
-Great interest in tablet - I would recommend to others great playing games reading surfing the Internet.Camera works very good and easy upload photos when needed.

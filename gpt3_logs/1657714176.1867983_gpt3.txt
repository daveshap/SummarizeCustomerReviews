Great product, a little hard to set up for android - Size, brightness, and convenience are good. The option to link with android products for messages is a little hard.
-Perfect combination of a tablet and reader - I bought this kindle for my dad. The size is just perfect, not too big nor too small, and light to carry around.
-great for the price! - This is a low cost tablet. It offers many of the same features as higher priced tablets. Good buy!
-Great tablet for the money - I truly enjoy this product. I have an older one but this is superb in all areas of entertainment.
-Excellent Functionality & Value - The Kindle is a great way to read and watch videos with ease!
-Is what it is - Exactly what I expected. I own three of these already.
-Loving it! - I love this Kindle Fire....I bought it as a reader but really about the only thing I can't do on it is make phone calls. Great price for a great product.
-Great value and super warranty - The value was there with a sale price reduction of $30. Especially for the 16GB model. Another key factor is the 2 year no questions asked warranty replacement. A valuable consideration for a tablet primarily used by a child.
-I enjoyed it - I bought it in best buy for 30 dollars. Its very good except camera. Memory can be expanded. So far, im using it without any issues
-Very nice tablet - This tablet was inexpensive, very lightweight, and performs just as good as the more expensive ones.
-Wonderful tablet for kids - I bought it for my niece who is 7 seven years old. She loves it and she learns from the applications included.

-Great - I really enjoy my amazon. It is getting easyer to use and I am finding new apps every day.
-Great features! - The Amazon Fire Hd8 has great features. The size is perfect to carry anywhere. Excellent apps and accessible to books, movies, games etc. Clear screen. it was very quick and easy to setup and begin using.
-Great for kids!!! - I have a four year old daughter who has learned a lot from using this tablet. The child feature is great because she can access everything for her age in one area ( with parental settings of course). I really love this tablet
-Works Great - I bought 4 of these tablets this Christmas as gifts and they work as expected
-I bought one for me and one for each of my nieces. - I use mine mainly for its bigger screen. I do all the same things i do on my phone..but love the big screen. I bought one for eaxh of my nieces too. And they both love theres. Making videos..playing music..reading books. They bith love them! Im happy i got them for all of us. And always reccomend them to my friends for their kids too.
-Fun to play with. - If you're a Amazon frequent flyer like me, HD fire is very fun and convenient placing all aspects of Amazon at your finger tips. The only thing i dont like about it is that its slow like most tablets.
-Grandson loves it - Works great and have not had any issues. The case is great for younger kids
-very easy to use and is very durable. - Bought this for my granddaughter who was 2 at the time. She loves it. It is very easy to use and is very durable. The kindle has been dropped, thrown and sat on and it still works like it did when it was first purchased. Am considering buying one for her younger brother.
-Good tablet for kids. - Ok I purchased this tablet specifically for my two year old for her birthday. So far she loves it but gets tired of the kids included amazon trial videos. So I end up logging into my user account for her to be able to go on YouTube. But she really likes and enjoys her new tablet. Over all it's a good tablet for kids. What had me on purchasing this tablet was the free no question asked replacement warranty. She has dropped it many times but the included foam case has protected the tablet every time.
-Great first tab - Great first tab for game playing and basic web surfing. Enough speed to navigate the web and for multiwindow tasking.
-Nice travel companion - Bought to use for recent travel. Was able to download several movies and TV shows from Netflix. Seems to have decent storage. Video playback was fine.
-Easy to use for my 9 yr old - My daughter loves it!! Great color, light weight, rubber cover for protection.

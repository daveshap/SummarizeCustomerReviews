Awsome - So easy to use super clear can't. Beat the price all around great buy

-Good Price great tablet - Needed a tough little tablet for my grandson. Had it a couple of months and has held up very well.
-Great - Love my mine! Works great with prime! And I have all my best movies!
-GREAT VALUE - BOUGHT MINE ON BLACK FRIDAY AND IT IS AWESOME. MY FIRST TABLET AND IT IS GREAT WITH ALL OF THE AMAZON FEATURES.
-Gift for my GF - My girlfriend has been wanting an e-reader for a while now. She reads rather quickly, so she wants to have the option of taking more than one book with her. Got her this, loaded up her Amazon library, and she hadn't put the thing down. She says the screen is the perfect size for reading, and the option to use a black background with white text has been really easy on her eyes. Even at full price, I'd have called this a win. On sale, I call this total victory.
-Great gift! - Bought this for my adult son who had a long flight and he absolutely loved it! Definitely recommend!
-Love using Kindle Fire - Love my new Kindle Fire - easy to use - the battery life is amazing!!
-Good - But could be much better. - Video quality is very good. Works well with Amazon Prime Video and Music - no surprises there. Apps are VERY disappointing - many common apps are not available - even though there are Android versions! Not bad if you have modest expectations.
-Tablet works pretty good, just getting started. - I know many people who have a kindle. It frees up using the cell phone memory, so I bought this one for the amount of storage it has, as well as the cost of the item. Thank you.

-Awesome kids tablet - This is an excellent tool to help our granddaughter advance her learning skills and also allows her an opportunity to play educational games
